I will teach you professional captcha bypass





















Since you will pay $0.64 per captcha, I suggest you reCAPTCHA v2 200K

first we should download https://github.com/capsolver/capsolver-python after we will write import capsolver and enter our api key we will get api key from https://dashboard.capsolver.com/dashboard/overview after we will write capsolver.api_key="your capsolver api key" solution = capsolver.solve({ "type":"", "websiteKey":"", "websiteURL":"", }) now i will tell what is that things first we will take captcha value we will press f12 and "we will https://recaptha...k="take this value" and print this to websitekey

solution = capsolver.solve({ "type":"", "websiteKey":"the value after https://recaptha...k= ", "websiteURL":"https://website.com", })

and now i will tell what is type. It s mean what we bypassing which captcha first we will enter capsolver website after click createtask after click view all supported... after there will be two recaptcha and they are proxyless and proxy. I will explain proxyles one week after i will explain with proxy recaptcha. we will write type solution = capsolver.solve({ "type":"ReCaptchaV2TaskProxyless", "websiteKey":"the value after https://recaptha...k= ", "websiteURL":"https://website.com", }) now print(solution) will bypass recaptcha

now i will tell how we can use that with requests module
first we will open requests.session
s=requests.session()
s.headers={
"your user agent"
}
r= s.get("website.com")
print(s.cookies.get_dict())
#we should import html from lxml
from lxml import html
agac= html.fromstring(r.content)
now we should get the thing we want do now press f12 and after we must find the element of button we want click (not recaptcha) and we will right click and copy xpath value1= agac.xpath("xpathvalue") value2= agac.xpath("otherxpathvalue") and now print(value1) print(value2) and it will solve
